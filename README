this is a multithreaded disk i/o microbenchmark.  it requires O_DIRECT,
pread/pwrite, and pthreads.

WARNING: this will destroy data if used incorrectly.

usage: ./randomio filename nr_threads write_fraction_of_io fsync_fraction_of_writes io_size nr_seconds_between_samples

filename
        filename or device to read/write.

write_fraction_of_io
        what fraction of i/o should be writes.  for example 0.25 for
        25% write traffic.

fsync_fraction_of_writes
        what fraction of writes should be fsync'd.

io_size
        how many bytes to read/write.  must be a positive multiple
        of 512 bytes

nr_seconds_between_samples
        how many seconds to average samples over.  recommended 10 or
        more.


for example:

% ./randomio /dev/sdb 8 0.5 1 4096 10
